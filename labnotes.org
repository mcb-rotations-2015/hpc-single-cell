* <2015-09-13 Sun> Running dn_sample.tsv
- Completed scripts ~parallel-macse.sh~ and ~sbatch-macse.sh~.
  - Added support for bash parameters.
  - Added usage messages.
  - Issues in ~parallel-macse.sh~:
    - Each task output should redirect into separate files in a
      directory named after the SLURM job ID, since in a single file
      the output gets all jumbled up.
      - Need some way of mapping the SLURM job.batch ID to the
	individual log name.  This is probably the same as ~{#}~ of
	GNU Parallel.
      - Create new ~--output-dir~ option for ~parallel-macse.sh~.
    - joblog is named by the file suffix instead of its prefix.  Need
      to replace ~##~ with ~%%~ and transpose ~*.~ to ~.*~
      - Don't fix this bug until all jobs complete successfully.
- Encountered at least 4 Java OutOfMemory errors.  Added ~java
  -verbose:gc~ to see last garbage collection attempt before it runs
  out of memory to get an idea of much memory is available.  But,
  should first fix the issue of separate log files for this
  enhancement to be useful.

* <2015-09-12 Sat> GNU Parallel experimentation
- Read GNU Parallel man page.
- Ran GNU Parallel tutorial.
- Created [[https://www.becat.uconn.edu/wiki/index.php/Parallel_Guide][BECAT wiki guide]] for GNU Parallel.
- Refactored batch script to use builtin features of GNU Parallel.
  - Added ~--arg-file~ instead of mapping integers to the tsv rows.
  - Added ~--header~~ for named column selection.
  - Got rid of bash functions which were doing these things.
